# System Design Challenge

Imagine you're building a **Community Resource Sharing Platform**. Users can post what they have (resources to give) and what they need (resources to receive).

---

## 🎯 Goal:

Design a scalable system that allows users to:

1. **Register/Login**
2. **Post Resources (Need/Offer)**
3. **Search & Match Listings**
4. **Communicate with Others**
5. **View Basic Admin Analytics**

---

## 🏗️ What You Need to Do:

- Describe your **backend architecture** (monolith or microservices?)
- Choose your **database** (SQL or NoSQL, and why?)
- Include **data flow diagrams** or a simple sketch (optional but preferred)
- Mention any **third-party tools** you’d use (e.g., Redis, Kafka, Firebase)
- Describe how you would ensure **scalability and security**

---

## 💡 Example (optional):

You can describe your architecture like this:

- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Frontend: React
- DB: MongoDB for flexibility
- Auth: JWT
- Services: Messaging service (WebSocket), Caching (Redis)

---

## 📋 Submission Format:
